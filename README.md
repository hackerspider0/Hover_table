# Hover_table

I need to highlight a table row and change opacity of one cell. It would be nice to get a background color when hovering over a row and also change the opacity of the last to 1

That's how I changed the opacity of the last column. This only changes the opacity when hovering exactly of the last values but it would be nice if the last values also change to 1 when hovering somewhere on the whole row
